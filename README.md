# Student
This mini project is made by me during training period under Cipher School



These are the commands for virtual environment :

1. pip install poetry
2. poetry init
3. poetry shell
4. poetry add django
5. python manage.py runserver


If I share my project with someone they need to do two commands:
1. poetry shell
2. poetry install 

And all the dependecies will be installed in their system.
