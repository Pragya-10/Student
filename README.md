# Student
This mini project is made by me during training period under Cipher School



These are the commands for virtual environment :

pip install poetry
poetry init
poetry shell
poetry add django
python manage.py runserver


If I share my project with someone they need to do two commands:
poetry shell
poetry install 

And all the dependecies will be installed in their system.
